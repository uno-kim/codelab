                Talk to you soon,

                Hi friends,

                I was at the grocery store on Sunday night.. when I ran into Genie Williams! I almost didn't recognize her afer 20 years!

                Anyway, it turns out she is on the organizing committee for the high school reunion this fall. I don't know if you were planning on going or not, but she could definitely use our help in trying to track down lots of missing alums. If you can make it, we're doing a little phone-tree party at her place next Saturday, hoping that if we can find one person, thee more will...

                I've been doing a bit of research and have come across a few paces in Northern Brazil that I think we should check out. One, the north has some of the most predictable wind on the planet. I'd love to get out on the ocean and kitesurf for a couple of days if we're going to be anywhere near or around Taiba. I hear it's beautiful there and if you're up for it, I'd love to go. Other than that, I haven't spent too much time looking into places along our road trip route. I'm assuming we can find places to stay and things to do as we drive and find places we think look interesting. But... I know you're more of a planner, so if you have ideas or places in mind, lets jot some ideas down!

                Maybe we can jump on the phone later today if you have a second.
